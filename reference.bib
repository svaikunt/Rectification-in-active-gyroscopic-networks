We demonstrate that the adiabatic pump and the reversible ratchet effects, as well as similar new phenomena in other domains, such as in epidemiology, all follow from very similar geometric phase contributions to the effective action in the stochastic path integral representation of the moment generating function. The theory provides the universal technique for identification, prediction, and calculation of pumplike phenomena in an arbitrary mesoscopic stochastic framework.},

  abstract = {We consider transport properties of a two dimensional topological insulator in a double quantum point contact geometry in presence of a time-dependent external field. In the proposed setup an external gate is placed above a single constriction and it couples only with electrons belonging to the top edge. This asymmetric configuration and the presence of an ac signal allow for a quantum pumping mechanism, which, in turn, can generate finite heat and charge currents in an unbiased device configuration. A microscopic model for the coupling with the external time-dependent gate potential is developed and the induced finite heat and charge currents are investigated. We demonstrate that in the non-interacting case, heat flow is associated with a single spin component, due to the helical nature of the edge states, and therefore a finite and polarized heat current is obtained in this configuration. The presence of e-e interchannel interactions strongly affects the current signal, lowering the degree of polarization of the system. Finally, we also show that separate heat and charge flows can be achieved, varying the amplitude of the external gate.},

Equilibrium and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics methods are presented along with a critical survey of previous numerical results. Analytical results for the non-equilibrium dynamics can be obtained in the harmonic chain where the role of disorder and localization can be also understood.

Simple toy models can be defined in which the conductivity is finite. Anomalous transport in integrable non-linear systems is briefly discussed.

  title = {Fundamental Aspects of Steady-State Conversion of Heat to Work at the Nanoscale},
  volume = {694},
  issn = {03701573},
  abstract = {In recent years, the study of heat to work conversion has been re-invigorated by nanotechnology. Steady-state devices do this conversion without any macroscopic moving parts, through steady-state flows of microscopic particles such as electrons, photons, phonons, etc. This review aims to introduce some of the theories used to describe these steady-state flows in a variety of mesoscopic or nanoscale systems. These theories are introduced in the context of idealized machines which convert heat into electrical power (heat-engines) or convert electrical power into a heat flow (refrigerators). In this sense, the machines could be categorized as thermoelectrics, although this should be understood to include photovoltaics when the heat source is the sun. As quantum mechanics is important for most such machines, they fall into the field of quantum thermodynamics. In many cases, the machines we consider have few degrees of freedom, however the reservoirs of heat and work that they interact with are assumed to be macroscopic. This review discusses different theories which can take into account different aspects of mesoscopic and nanoscale physics, such as coherent quantum transport, magnetic-field induced effects (including topological ones such as the quantum Hall effect), and single electron charging effects. It discusses the efficiency of thermoelectric conversion, and the thermoelectric figure of merit. More specifically, the theories presented are (i) linear response theory with or without magnetic fields, (ii) Landauer scattering theory in the linear response regime and far from equilibrium, (iii) Green\textendash{}Kubo formula for strongly interacting systems within the linear response regime, (iv) rate equation analysis for small quantum machines with or without interaction effects, (v) stochastic thermodynamic for fluctuating small systems. In all cases, we place particular emphasis on the fundamental questions about the bounds on ideal machines. Can magnetic-fields change the bounds on power or efficiency? What is the relationship between quantum theories of transport and the laws of thermodynamics? Does quantum mechanics place fundamental bounds on heat to work conversion which are absent in the thermodynamics of classical systems?},

Our scheme relies on breaking time-reversal symmetry by a spatially varying laser drive, which manipulates low-energy acoustic phonons. Furthermore, we take advantage of recent developments in the manipulation of high-energy phonons through controlled scattering mechanisms, such as using alloys and introducing disorder. These combined approaches allow us to design an acoustic isolator and a thermal diode.

  abstract = {The form of energy termed heat that typically derives from lattice vibrations, i.e., phonons, is usually considered as waste energy and, moreover, deleterious to information processing. However, in this Colloquium, an attempt is made to rebut this common view: By use of tailored models it is demonstrated that phonons can be manipulated similarly to electrons and photons, thus enabling controlled heat transport. Moreover, it is explained that phonons can be put to beneficial use to carry and process information. In the first part ways are presented to control heat transport and to process information for physical systems which are driven by a temperature bias. In particular, a toolkit of familiar electronic analogs for use of phononics is put forward, i.e., phononic devices are described which act as thermal diodes, thermal transistors, thermal logic gates, and thermal memories. These concepts are then put to work to transport, control, and rectify heat in physically realistic nanosystems by devising practical designs of hybrid nanostructures that permit the operation of functional phononic devices; the first experimental realizations are also reported. Next, richer possibilities to manipulate heat flow by use of time-varying thermal bath temperatures or various other external fields are discussed. These give rise to many intriguing phononic nonequilibrium phenomena such as, for example, the directed shuttling of heat, geometrical phase-induced heat pumping, or the phonon Hall effect, which may all find their way into operation with electronic analogs.},

Both cases share the same Langevin equation that is obtained by setting the mass to zero in the original Langevin equation. The equivalence breaks down in the presence of the Lorentz force. The low mass limit turns out to be singular. The system in the low mass limit is different from the system with zero mass. The low mass limit is also different from the large friction limit.

However, delivery on target sites usually requires external control fields to steer propellers and trigger cargo release. The need for a constant feedback mechanism prevents the design of compact devices where biopropellers could perform their tasks autonomously. Here we show that properly designed three-dimensional (3D) microstructures can define accumulation areas where bacteria spontaneously and efficiently store colloidal beads. The process is stochastic in nature and results from the rectifying action of an asymmetric energy landscape over the fluctuating forces arising from collisions with swimming bacteria. As a result, the concentration of colloids over target areas can be strongly increased or depleted according to the topography of the underlying structures. Besides the significance to technological applications, our experiments pose some important questions regarding the structure of stationary probability distributions in non-equilibrium systems.},

  abstract = {Transport phenomena in spatially periodic systems far from thermal equilibrium are considered. The main emphasis is put on directed transport in so-called Brownian motors (ratchets), i.e. a dissipative dynamics in the presence of thermal noise and some prototypical perturbation that drives the system out of equilibrium without introducing a priori an obvious bias into one or the other direction of motion. Symmetry conditions for the appearance (or not) of directed current, its inversion upon variation of certain parameters, and quantitative theoretical predictions for specific models are reviewed as well as a wide variety of experimental realizations and biological applications, especially the modeling of molecular motors. Extensions include quantum mechanical and collective effects, Hamiltonian ratchets, the influence of spatial disorder, and diffusive transport. \textcopyright{} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {This review summarizes theoretical progress in the field of active matter, placing it in the context of recent experiments. This approach offers a unified framework for the mechanical and statistical properties of living matter: biofilaments and molecular motors in vitro or in vivo, collections of motile microorganisms, animal flocks, and chemical or mechanical imitations. A major goal of this review is to integrate several approaches proposed in the literature, from semimicroscopic to phenomenological. In particular, first considered are ``dry'' systems, defined as those where momentum is not conserved due to friction with a substrate or an embedding porous medium. The differences and similarities between two types of orientationally ordered states, the nematic and the polar, are clarified. Next, the active hydrodynamics of suspensions or ``wet'' systems is discussed and the relation with and difference from the dry case, as well as various large-scale instabilities of these nonequilibrium states of matter, are highlighted. Further highlighted are various large-scale instabilities of these nonequilibrium states of matter. Various semimicroscopic derivations of the continuum theory are discussed and connected, highlighting the unifying and generic nature of the continuum model. Throughout the review, the experimental relevance of these theories for describing bacterial swarms and suspensions, the cytoskeleton of living cells, and vibrated granular material is discussed. Promising extensions toward greater realism in specific contexts from cell biology to animal behavior are suggested, and remarks are given on some exotic active-matter analogs. Last, the outlook for a quantitative understanding of active matter, through the interplay of detailed theory with controlled experiments on simplified systems, with living or artificial constituents, is summarized.},

To do so, we compute perturbatively their steady-state measure and show that, for short persistent times, the entropy production rate vanishes. This endows such systems with an effective Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem akin to that of thermal equilibrium systems. Last we show how interacting particle systems with viscous drags and correlated noises can be seen as in equilibrium with a visco-elastic bath but driven out of equilibrium by non-conservative forces, hence providing an energetic insight on the departure of active systems from equilibrium.},

These small-scale motors exhibit unique features in terms of power and efficiency fluctuations that have no equivalent in the macroscopic world. We also consider a second pathway for work extraction from colloidal engines operating between active bacterial reservoirs at different temperatures, which could significantly boost the performance of passive heat engines at the mesoscale.

These active liquids can flow spontaneously even in the absence of an external drive. Unlike spontaneous active flow, the propagation of density waves in confined active liquids is not well explored. Here, we exploit a mapping between density waves on top of a chiral flow and electrons in a synthetic gauge field to lay out design principles for artificial structures termed topological active metamaterials. We design metamaterials that break time-reversal symmetry using lattices composed of annular channels filled with a spontaneously flowing active liquid. Such active metamaterials support topologically protected sound modes that propagate unidirectionally, without backscattering, along either sample edges or domain walls and despite overdamped particle dynamics. Our work illustrates how parity-symmetry breaking in metamaterial structure combined with microscopic irreversibility of active matter leads to novel functionalities that cannot be achieved using only passive materials.},

In the presence of curvature orientationally ordered polar flocks are forced to be inhomogeneous, often requiring the presence of topological defects even in the steady state due to the constraints imposed by the topology of the underlying surface. In the presence of spontaneous flow the system additionally supports long-wavelength propagating sound modes which get gapped by the curvature of the underlying substrate. We analytically compute the steady state profile of an active polar flock on a two-sphere and a catenoid, and show that curvature and active flow together result in symmetry protected topological modes that get localized to special geodesics on the surface (the equator or the neck respectively). These modes are the analogue of edge states in electronic quantum Hall systems and provide unidirectional channels for information transport in the flock, robust against disorder and backscattering.},

  abstract = {We report a new type of phononic crystals with topologically non-trivial bandgaps for both longit-udinal and transverse polarizations, resulting in protected one-way elastic edge waves. In our design, gyroscopic inertial effects are used to break the time-reversal symmetry and realize the phononic analogue of the electronic quantum Hall effect. We investigate the response of both hexagonal and square gyroscopic lattices and observe bulk Chern number of 1 and 2, indicating that these struc-tures support single and multi-mode edge elastic waves immune to back-scattering. These robust one-way phononic waveguides could potentially lead to the design of a novel class of surface wave devices that are widely used in electronics, telecommunication and acoustic imaging. Topological states in electronic materials, including the quantum Hall effect [1] and topological insulat-ors [2, 3], have inspired a number of recent develop-ments in photonics [4, 5], phononics [6\textendash{}10] and mechan-ical metamaterials [11\textendash{}14]. In particular, in analogy to the quantum anomalous Hall effect [15], one-way wave-guides in two-dimensional photonic systems have been realized by breaking time-reversal symmetry [16\textendash{}18]. Moreover, very recently unidirectional edge channels have also been proposed for scalar acoustic waves by rotating fluids [19, 20] and for elastic waves by Coriolis force in a non-inertial reference frame [21]. However, the latter system is very difficult to implement in solid state devices. Here, we introduce gyroscopic phononic crystals, where each lattice site is coupled with a spinning gyro-scope that breaks time-reversal symmetry in a well-controlled manner. In both hexagonal and square lat-tices, gyroscopic coupling opens bandgaps character-ized by Chern numbers of 1 and 2. As a result, at the edge of these lattices both single-mode and multi-mode one-way elastic waves are observed to propagate around arbitrary defects without backscattering. To start, we consider a hexagonal phononic crys-tal with equal masses (m 2 = m 1) connected by lin-ear springs (green and black rods in Figs. 1a, 1b and 1c). The resulting unit cell has four degrees of freedom specified by the displacements of m 1 and m 2 (U = [u m1},

  abstract = {Despite intense interest in realizing topological phases across a variety of electronic, photonic and mechanical platforms, the detailed microscopic origin of topological behavior often remains elusive. To bridge this conceptual gap, we show how hallmarks of topological modes - boundary localization and chirality - emerge from Newton's laws in mechanical topological systems. We first construct a gyroscopic lattice with analytically solvable edge modes, and show how the Lorentz and spring restoring forces conspire to support very robust "dangling bond" boundary modes. The chirality and locality of these modes intuitively emerges from microscopic balancing of restoring forces and cyclotron tendencies. Next, we introduce the highlight of this work, a very experimentally realistic mechanical non-equilibrium (Floquet) Chern lattice driven by AC electromagnets. Through appropriate synchronization of the AC driving protocol, the Floquet lattice is "pushed around" by a rotating potential analogous to an object washed ashore by water waves. Besides hosting "dangling bond" chiral modes analogous to the gyroscopic boundary modes, our Floquet Chern lattice also supports peculiar half-period chiral modes with no static analog. With key parameters controlled electronically, our setup has the advantage of being dynamically tunable for applications involving arbitrary Floquet modulations. The physical intuition gleaned from our two prototypical topological systems are applicable not just to arbitrarily complicated mechanical systems, but also photonic and electrical topological setups.},

When these are balanced, the system is on the verge of mechanical instability and is termed isostatic. It has recently been shown that certain extended isostatic lattices exhibit floppy modes localized at their boundary. These boundary modes are insensitive to local perturbations, and seem to have a topological origin, reminiscent of the protected electronic boundary modes that occur in the quantum Hall effect and in topological insulators. Here, we establish the connection between the topological mechanical modes and the topological band theory of electronic systems, and we predict the existence of new topological bulk mechanical phases with distinct boundary modes.

This pedagogical review focuses on the properties of frames with z at or near zc, which model systems like randomly packed spheres near jamming and network glasses. Using an index theorem, N0 -NS = dN -NB relating the number of sites, N, and number of bonds, NB, to the number, N0, of modes of zero energy and the number, NS, of states of self stress, in which springs can be under positive or negative tension while forces on sites remain zero, it explores the properties of periodic square, kagome, and related lattices for which z = zc and the relation between states of self stress and zero modes in periodic lattices to the surface zero modes of finite free lattices (with free boundary conditions). It shows how modifications to the periodic kagome lattice can eliminate all but trivial translational zero modes and create topologically distinct classes, analogous to those of topological insulators, with protected zero modes at free boundaries and at interfaces between different topological classes.},

  abstract = {As technological advances allow us to fabricate smaller autonomous self-propelled devices, it is clear that at some point directed propulsion could not come from pre-specified deterministic periodic deformation of the swimmer's body and we need to develop strategies for extracting a net directed motion from a series of random transitions in the conformation space of the swimmer. We present a theoretical formulation for describing the 'stochastic motor' that drives the motion of low Reynolds number swimmers based on this concept, and use it to study the propulsion of a simple low Reynolds number swimmer, namely, the three-sphere swimmer model. When the detailed balanced is broken and the motor is driven out of equilibrium, it can propel the swimmer in the required direction. The formulation can be used to study optimal design strategies for molecular scale low Reynolds number swimmers.},

We study a very simple mechanism to induce fluid pumping, based on the forced motion of three colloidal beads through a cycle that breaks time-reversal symmetry. Optical tweezers are used to vary the inter-bead distance. This model is inspired by a strut-based theoretical swimmer proposed by Najafi and Golestanian [Phys.Rev.

  abstract = {Large objects which propel themselves in air or water make use of inertia in the surrounding fluid. The propulsive organ pushes the fluid backwards, while the resistance of the body gives the fluid a forward momentum. The forward and backward momenta exactly balance, but the propulsive organ and the resistance can be thought about as acting separately. This conception cannot be transferred to problems of propulsion in microscopic bodies for which the stresses due to viscosity may be many thousands of times as great as those due to inertia. No case of self-propulsion in a viscous fluid due to purely viscous forces seems to have been discussed. The motion of a fluid near a sheet down which waves of lateral displacement are propagated is described. It is found that the sheet moves forwards at a rate 2\$\textbackslash{}pi \^\{2\}\$b\$\^\{2\}\$/\$\textbackslash{}lambda \^\{2\}\$ times the velocity of propagation of the waves. Here b is the amplitude and \$\textbackslash{}lambda \$ the wave-length. This analysis seems to explain how a propulsive tail can move a body through a viscous fluid without relying on reaction due to inertia. The energy dissipation and stress in the tail are also calculated. The work is extended to explore the reaction between the tails of two neighbouring small organisms with propulsive tails. It is found that if the waves down neighbouring tails are in phase very much less energy is dissipated in the fluid between them than when the waves are in opposite phase. It is also found that when the phase of the wave in one tail lags behind that in the other there is a strong reaction, due to the viscous stress in the fluid between them, which tends to force the two wave trains into phase. It is in fact observed that the tails of spermatozoa wave in unison when they are close to one another and pointing the same way.},

The nonequilibrium forces exerted by the active bath on the inclusions or boundaries often regulate function, and such forces may also be exploited in artificial active materials. Nonetheless, the general phenomenology of these active forces remains elusive. We show that the fluctuation spectrum of the active medium, the partitioning of energy as a function of wavenumber, controls the phenomenology of force generation. We find that, for a narrow, unimodal spectrum, the force exerted by a nonequilibrium system on two embedded walls depends on the width and the position of the peak in the fluctuation spectrum, and oscillates between repulsion and attraction as a function of wall separation. We examine two apparently disparate examples: the Maritime Casimir effect and recent simulations of active Brownian particles. A key implication of our work is that important nonequilibrium interactions are encoded within the fluctuation spectrum. In this sense, the noise becomes the signal.},

The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently\textemdash{}those with short-range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine which allows for message-passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers--the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y-MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90\% and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C9O processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed.},

Engineered zero modes have the potential to act as microscopic motors or memory devices, but this requires an internal actuation mechanism that can overcome unwanted fluctuations in other modes and the dissipation inherent in real systems. In this work, we show theoretically and experimentally that complex zero modes in mechanical networks can be selectively mobilized by non-equilibrium activity. We find that a correlated active bath actuates an infinitesimal zero mode while simultaneously suppressing fluctuations in higher modes compared to thermal fluctuations, which we experimentally mimic by high frequency shaking of a physical network. Furthermore, self-propulsive dynamics spontaneously mobilise finite mechanisms as exemplified by a self-propelled topological soliton. Non-equilibrium activity thus enables autonomous actuation of coordinated mechanisms engineered through network topology.},

  abstract = {Topological quantum and classical materials can exhibit robust properties that are protected against disorder, for example for noninteracting particles and linear waves. Here, we demonstrate how to construct topologically protected states that arise from the combination of strong interactions and thermal fluctuations inherent to soft materials or miniaturized mechanical structures. Specifically, we consider fluctuating lines under tension (e.g., polymer or vortex lines), subject to a class of spatially modulated substrate potentials. At equilibrium, the lines acquire a collective tilt proportional to an integer topological invariant called the Chern number. This quantized tilt is robust against substrate disorder, as verified by classical Langevin dynamics simulations. This robustness arises because excitations in this system of thermally fluctuating lines are gapped by virtue of inter-line interactions. We establish the topological underpinning of this pattern via a mapping that we develop between the interacting-lines system and a hitherto unexplored generalization of Thouless pumping to imaginary time. Our work points to a new class of classical topological phenomena in which the topological signature manifests itself in a structural property observed at finite temperature rather than a transport measurement.},

It applies whenever a non-equilibrium process is still coupled to one (or several) heat bath(s) of constant temperature. Paradigmatic systems are single colloidal particles in time-dependent laser traps, polymers in external flow, enzymes and molecular motors in single molecule assays, small biochemical networks and thermoelectric devices involving single electron transport. For such systems, a first-law like energy balance can be identified along fluctuating trajectories. For a basic Markovian dynamics implemented either on the continuum level with Langevin equations or on a discrete set of states as a master equation, thermodynamic consistency imposes a local-detailed balance constraint on noise and rates, respectively. Various integral and detailed fluctuation theorems, which are derived here in a unifying approach from one master theorem, constrain the probability distributions for work, heat and entropy production depending on the nature of the system and the choice of non-equilibrium conditions. For non-equilibrium steady states, particularly strong results hold like a generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem involving entropy production. Ramifications and applications of these concepts include optimal driving between specified states in finite time, the role of measurement-based feedback processes and the relation between dissipation and irreversibility. Efficiency and, in particular, efficiency at maximum power can be discussed systematically beyond the linear response regime for two classes of molecular machines, isothermal ones such as molecular motors, and heat engines such as thermoelectric devices, using a common framework based on a cycle decomposition of entropy production.},

These devices have greatly improved our ability to process microwaves by interfacing them to orders-of-magnitude slower and lower-loss mechanical fields. In parallel, long-distance communications have been dominated by low-loss infrared optical photons. As electrical signal processing and transmission approach physical limits imposed by energy dissipation, optical links are now being actively considered for mobile and cloud technologies. Thus there is a strong driver for wavelength-scale mechanical wave or \&\#x201C;phononic\&\#x201D; circuitry fabricated by scalable semiconductor processes. With the advent of these circuits, new micro- and nanostructures that combine electrical, optical, and mechanical elements have emerged. In these devices, such as optomechanical waveguides and resonators, optical photons and gigahertz phonons are ideally matched to one another, as both have wavelengths on the order of micrometers. The development of phononic circuits has thus emerged as a vibrant field of research pursued for optical signal processing and sensing applications as well as emerging quantum technologies. In this review, we discuss the key physics and figures of merit underpinning this field. We also summarize the state of the art in nanoscale electro- and optomechanical systems with a focus on scalable platforms such as silicon. Finally, we give perspectives on what these new systems may bring and what challenges they face in the coming years. In particular, we believe hybrid electro- and optomechanical devices incorporating highly coherent and compact mechanical elements on a chip have significant untapped potential for electro-optic modulation, quantum microwave-to-optical photon conversion, sensing, and microwave signal processing.},

at minimizing undesired thermal energy barriers that generically obstruct
kinematic mechanisms at the microscale. Our findings are illustrated in the
context of a quasi one-dimensional linkage structure that harbors a
topologically protected mechanism. However, thermal fluctuations can also be
exploited to deliberately lock a reconfigurable metamaterial into a fully
expanded configuration, a process reminiscent of order by disorder transitions
in magnetic systems. We demonstrate that this effect leads certain topological
mechanical structures to exhibit an abrupt change in the pressure -- a bulk
signature of the underlying topological invariant at finite temperature. We
conclude with a discussion of anharmonic corrections and potential applications

Oster. 1993. Cellular motions and thermal fluctuations: the Brownian ratchet. Biophys. J. 65:316\textendash{}324). Their "Brownian ratchet" model assumed that the filament was stiff and that thermal fluctuations affected only the "load," i.e., the object being pushed. However, under many conditions of biological interest, the thermal fluctuations of the load are insufficient to produce the observed motions. Here we shall show that the thermal motions of the polymerizing filaments can produce a directed force. This "elastic Brownian ratchet" can explain quantitatively the propulsion of Listeria and the protrusive mechanics of lamellipodia. The model also explains how the polymerization process nucleates the orthogonal structure of the actin network in lamellipodia.},

  shorttitle = {Great Expectations},
  abstract = {The development and fabrication of mechanical devices powered by artificial molecular machines is one of the contemporary goals of nanoscience. Before this goal can be realized, however, we must learn how to control the coupling/uncoupling to the environment of individual switchable molecules, and also how to integrate these bistable molecules into organized, hierarchical assemblies that can perform significant work on their immediate environment at nano-, micro- and macroscopic levels. In this tutorial review, we seek to draw an all-important distinction between artificial molecular switches which are now ten a penny\textemdash{}or a dime a dozen\textemdash{}in the chemical literature and artificial molecular machines which are few and far between despite the ubiquitous presence of their naturally occurring counterparts in living systems. At the single molecule level, a prevailing perspective as to how machine-like characteristics may be achieved focuses on harnessing, rather than competing with, the ineluctable effects of thermal noise. At the macroscopic level, one of the major challenges inherent to the construction of machine-like assemblies lies in our ability to control the spatial ordering of switchable molecules\textemdash{}e.g., into linear chains and then into muscle-like bundles\textemdash{}and to influence the cross-talk between their switching kinetics. In this regard, situations where all the bistable molecules switch synchronously appear desirable for maximizing mechanical power generated. On the other hand, when the bistable molecules switch ``out of phase,'' the assemblies could develop intricate spatial or spatiotemporal patterns. Assembling and controlling synergistically artificial molecular machines housed in highly interactive and robust architectural domains heralds a game-changer for chemical synthesis and a defining moment for nanofabrication.},

  abstract = {Ratchet effects can arise for single or collectively interacting Brownian particles on an asymmetric substrate when a net dc transport is produced by an externally applied ac driving force or by periodically flashing the substrate. Recently, a new class of active ratchet systems that do not require the application of external driving has been realized through the use of active matter; they are self-propelled units that can be biological or nonbiological in nature. When active materials such as swimming bacteria interact with an asymmetric substrate, a net dc directed motion can arise even without external driving, opening a wealth of possibilities such as sorting, cargo transport, or micromachine construction. We review the current status of active matter ratchets for swimming bacteria, cells, active colloids, and swarming models, focusing on the role of particle-substrate interactions. We describe ratchet reversals produced by collective effects and the use of active ratchets to transport passive particles. We discuss future directions including deformable substrates or particles, the role of different swimming modes, varied particle\textendash{}particle interactions, and nondissipative effects.},

The control of heat conduction by nonlinearity opens the possibility to propose new devices such as a thermal rectifier.},

We first focus on steady state properties, namely, on the impact of the singular measure of the reservoir in the steady state energy. We introduce the concept of temperatures of higher order, which aim to represent the effect produced by the cumulants of the noise of order larger than 2 in the form of sources of energy of higher order and new response functions such as high-order specific heats that zero out when the system is thermal or linear. Afterwards, we study the effect of the nature of the noise in the heat and energy fluxes and determine asymptotic expressions for its large deviation functions. Finally, by analyzing the probabilistics of the injected power, we verify that the exponential form of its fluctuation relation is only asymptotically valid, whereas in the thermal case it is valid for the injected power at all times.},

This induces a Coriolis force that acts exactly as the Lorentz force in a magnetic field. Experimental normal mode measurements for a small dust cluster with four particles show excellent agreement with theoretical predictions for a magnetized plasma.},

Breaking this transmission symmetry offers enhanced control over signal transport, isolation and source protection1,2,3,4,5,6. So far, devices that break reciprocity (and therefore show non-reciprocity) have been mostly considered in dynamic systems involving electromagnetic, acoustic and mechanical wave propagation associated with fields varying in space and time. Here we show that it is possible to break reciprocity in static systems, realizing mechanical metamaterials7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16 that exhibit vastly different output displacements under excitation from different sides, as well as one-way displacement amplification. This is achieved by combining large nonlinearities with suitable geometrical asymmetries and/or topological features. In addition to extending non-reciprocity and isolation to statics, our work sheds light on energy propagation in nonlinear materials with asymmetric crystalline structures and topological properties. We anticipate that breaking reciprocity will open avenues for energy absorption, conversion and harvesting, soft robotics, prosthetics and optomechanics.},
