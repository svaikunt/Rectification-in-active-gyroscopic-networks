@article{Pedro2018TopologicalInteractions,
abstract = {Topological quantum and classical materials can exhibit robust properties that are protected against disorder, for example for noninteracting particles and linear waves. Here, we demonstrate how to construct topologically protected states that arise from the combination of strong interactions and thermal fluctuations inherent to soft materials or miniaturized mechanical structures. Specifically, we consider fluctuating lines under tension (e.g., polymer or vortex lines), subject to a class of spatially modulated substrate potentials. At equilibrium, the lines acquire a collective tilt proportional to an integer topological invariant called the Chern number. This quantized tilt is robust against substrate disorder, as verified by classical Langevin dynamics simulations. This robustness arises because excitations in this system of thermally fluctuating lines are gapped by virtue of inter-line interactions. We establish the topological underpinning of this pattern via a mapping that we develop between the interacting-lines system and a hitherto unexplored generalization of Thouless pumping to imaginary time. Our work points to a new class of classical topological phenomena in which the topological signature manifests itself in a structural property observed at finite temperature rather than a transport measurement.},

@article{Plimpton1995FastDynamics,
abstract = {Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter-atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently—those with short-range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine which allows for message-passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers--the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y-MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90{\%} and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C9O processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed.},

@article{Lee2017FluctuationSystems.,
abstract = {Many biological systems are appropriately viewed as passive inclusions immersed in an active bath: from proteins on active membranes to microscopic swimmers confined by boundaries. The nonequilibrium forces exerted by the active bath on the inclusions or boundaries often regulate function, and such forces may also be exploited in artificial active materials. Nonetheless, the general phenomenology of these active forces remains elusive. We show that the fluctuation spectrum of the active medium, the partitioning of energy as a function of wavenumber, controls the phenomenology of force generation. We find that, for a narrow, unimodal spectrum, the force exerted by a nonequilibrium system on two embedded walls depends on the width and the position of the peak in the fluctuation spectrum, and oscillates between repulsion and attraction as a function of wall separation. We examine two apparently disparate examples: the Maritime Casimir effect and recent simulations of active Brownian particles. A key implication of our work is that important nonequilibrium interactions are encoded within the fluctuation spectrum. In this sense, the noise becomes the signal.},

abstract = {Folding mechanisms are zero elastic energy motions essential to the deployment of origami, linkages, reconfigurable metamaterials and robotic structures. In this paper, we determine the fate of folding mechanisms when such structures are miniaturized so that thermal fluctuations cannot be neglected. First, we identify geometric and topological design strategies aimed at minimizing undesired thermal energy barriers that generically obstruct kinematic mechanisms at the microscale. Our findings are illustrated in the context of a quasi one-dimensional linkage structure that harbors a topologically protected mechanism. However, thermal fluctuations can also be exploited to deliberately lock a reconfigurable metamaterial into a fully expanded configuration, a process reminiscent of order by disorder transitions in magnetic systems. We demonstrate that this effect leads certain topological mechanical structures to exhibit an abrupt change in the pressure -- a bulk signature of the underlying topological invariant at finite temperature. We conclude with a discussion of anharmonic corrections and potential applications of our work to the the engineering of DNA origami devices and molecular robots.},

We exploit a class of recently introduced states of self-stress analogous to topological quantum states to sculpt localized buckling regions in the interior of periodic cellular metamaterials. Although the topological states of self-stress arise in the linear response of an idealized mechanical frame of harmonic springs connected by freely hinged joints, they leave a distinct signature in the nonlinear buckling behavior of a cellular material built out of elastic beams with rigid joints. The salient feature of these localized buckling regions is that they are indistinguishable from their surroundings as far as material parameters or connectivity of their constituent elements are concerned. Furthermore, they are robust against a wide range of structural perturbations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this topological design through analytical and numerical calculations as well as buckling experiments performed on two- and three-dimensional metamaterials built out of stacked kagome lattices.},

When z {\textless} zc ≈ 2d, where d is the spatial dimension, frames are unstable with respect to internal deformations. This pedagogical review focuses on the properties of frames with z at or near zc, which model systems like randomly packed spheres near jamming and network glasses. Using an index theorem, N0 −NS = dN −NB relating the number of sites, N, and number of bonds, NB, to the number, N0, of modes of zero energy and the number, NS, of states of self stress, in which springs can be under positive or negative tension while forces on sites remain zero, it explores the properties of periodic square, kagome, and related lattices for which z = zc and the relation between states of self stress and zero modes in periodic lattices to the surface zero modes of finite free lattices (with free boundary conditions). It shows how modifications to the periodic kagome lattice can eliminate all but trivial translational zero modes and create topologically distinct classes, analogous to those of topological insulators, with protected zero modes at free boundaries and at interfaces between different topological classes.},

abstract = {We introduce a numerical scheme to evolve functional elastic materials that can accomplish a specified mechanical task. In this scheme, the number of solutions, their spatial architectures, and the correlations among them can be computed. As an example, we consider an "allosteric" task, which requires the material to respond specifically to a stimulus at a distant active site. We find that functioning materials evolve a less-constrained trumpet-shaped region connecting the stimulus and active sites, and that the amplitude of the elastic response varies nonmonotonically along the trumpet. As previously shown for some proteins, we find that correlations appearing during evolution alone are sufficient to identify key aspects of this design. Finally, we show that the success of this architecture stems from the emergence of soft edge modes recently found to appear near the surface of marginally connected materials. Overall, our in silico evolution experiment offers a window to study the relationship between structure, function, and correlations emerging during evolution.},

@article{Rocks2017DesigningNetworks.,
abstract = {Recent advances in designing metamaterials have demonstrated that global mechanical properties of disordered spring networks can be tuned by selectively modifying only a small subset of bonds. Here, using a computationally efficient approach, we extend this idea to tune more general properties of networks. With nearly complete success, we are able to produce a strain between any two target nodes in a network in response to an applied source strain on any other pair of nodes by removing only ∼1{\%} of the bonds. We are also able to control multiple pairs of target nodes, each with a different individual response, from a single source, and to tune multiple independent source/target responses simultaneously into a network. We have fabricated physical networks in macroscopic 2D and 3D systems that exhibit these responses. This work is inspired by the long-range coupled conformational changes that constitute allosteric function in proteins. The fact that allostery is a common means for regulation in biological molecules suggests that it is a relatively easy property to develop through evolution. In analogy, our results show that long-range coupled mechanical responses are similarly easy to achieve in disordered networks.},

Here an approach consisting of the in silico design of synthetic structures, which, as the principal element of allostery, encode dynamical long-range coupling among two sites, is presented. The structures are represented by elastic networks, similar to coarse-grained models of real proteins. A strategy of evolutionary optimization was implemented to iteratively improve allosteric coupling. In the designed structures, allosteric interactions were analyzed in terms of strain propagation, and simple pathways that emerged during evolution were identified as signatures through which long-range communication was established. Moreover, robustness of allosteric performance with respect to mutations was demonstrated. As it turned out, the designed prototype structures reveal dynamical properties resembling those found in real allosteric proteins. Hence, they may serve as toy models of complex allosteric systems, such as proteins. Application of the developed modeling scheme to the allosteric transition in the myosin V molecular motor was also demonstrated.},

@article{Susstrunk2016ClassificationMetamaterials,
abstract = {Topological phononic crystals, alike their electronic counterparts, are characterized by a bulk-edge correspondence where the interior of a material dictates the existence of stable surface or boundary modes. In the mechanical setup, such surface modes can be used for various applications such as wave-guiding, vibration isolation, or the design of static properties such as stable floppy modes where parts of a system move freely. Here, we provide a classification scheme of topological phonons based on local symmetries. We import and adapt the classification of non-interacting electron systems and embed it into the mechanical setup. Moreover, we provide an extensive set of examples that illustrate our scheme and can be used to generate new models in unexplored symmetry classes. Our works unifies the vast recent literature on topological phonons and paves the way to future applications of topological surface modes in mechanical metamaterials.},

abstract = {The possibility of exploiting motile microorganisms as tiny propellers represents a fascinating strategy for the transport of colloidal cargoes. However, delivery on target sites usually requires external control fields to steer propellers and trigger cargo release. The need for a constant feedback mechanism prevents the design of compact devices where biopropellers could perform their tasks autonomously. Here we show that properly designed three-dimensional (3D) microstructures can define accumulation areas where bacteria spontaneously and efficiently store colloidal beads. The process is stochastic in nature and results from the rectifying action of an asymmetric energy landscape over the fluctuating forces arising from collisions with swimming bacteria. As a result, the concentration of colloids over target areas can be strongly increased or depleted according to the topography of the underlying structures. Besides the significance to technological applications, our experiments pose some important questions regarding the structure of stationary probability distributions in non-equilibrium systems.},

We consider such a system of interacting particles, propelled by persistent noises, and show that, at small but finite persistence time, their dynamics still satisfy a time-reversal symmetry. To do so, we compute perturbatively their steady-state measure and show that, for short persistent times, the entropy production rate vanishes. This endows such systems with an effective Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem akin to that of thermal equilibrium systems. Last we show how interacting particle systems with viscous drags and correlated noises can be seen as in equilibrium with a visco-elastic bath but driven out of equilibrium by non-conservative forces, hence providing an energetic insight on the departure of active systems from equilibrium.},

@article{Wang2015TopologicalWaves,
abstract = {We report a new type of phononic crystals with topologically non-trivial bandgaps for both longit-udinal and transverse polarizations, resulting in protected one-way elastic edge waves. In our design, gyroscopic inertial effects are used to break the time-reversal symmetry and realize the phononic analogue of the electronic quantum Hall effect. We investigate the response of both hexagonal and square gyroscopic lattices and observe bulk Chern number of 1 and 2, indicating that these struc-tures support single and multi-mode edge elastic waves immune to back-scattering. These robust one-way phononic waveguides could potentially lead to the design of a novel class of surface wave devices that are widely used in electronics, telecommunication and acoustic imaging. Topological states in electronic materials, including the quantum Hall effect [1] and topological insulat-ors [2, 3], have inspired a number of recent develop-ments in photonics [4, 5], phononics [6–10] and mechan-ical metamaterials [11–14]. In particular, in analogy to the quantum anomalous Hall effect [15], one-way wave-guides in two-dimensional photonic systems have been realized by breaking time-reversal symmetry [16–18]. Moreover, very recently unidirectional edge channels have also been proposed for scalar acoustic waves by rotating fluids [19, 20] and for elastic waves by Coriolis force in a non-inertial reference frame [21]. However, the latter system is very difficult to implement in solid state devices. Here, we introduce gyroscopic phononic crystals, where each lattice site is coupled with a spinning gyro-scope that breaks time-reversal symmetry in a well-controlled manner. In both hexagonal and square lat-tices, gyroscopic coupling opens bandgaps character-ized by Chern numbers of 1 and 2. As a result, at the edge of these lattices both single-mode and multi-mode one-way elastic waves are observed to propagate around arbitrary defects without backscattering. To start, we consider a hexagonal phononic crys-tal with equal masses (m 2 = m 1) connected by lin-ear springs (green and black rods in Figs. 1a, 1b and 1c). The resulting unit cell has four degrees of freedom specified by the displacements of m 1 and m 2 (U = [u m1},

abstract = {Frames, or lattices consisting of mass points connected by rigid bonds or central-force springs, are important model constructs that have applications in such diverse fields as structural engineering, architecture and materials science. The difference between the number of bonds and the number of degrees of freedom in these lattices determines the number of their zero-frequency /`floppy modes/'. When these are balanced, the system is on the verge of mechanical instability and is termed isostatic. It has recently been shown that certain extended isostatic lattices exhibit floppy modes localized at their boundary. These boundary modes are insensitive to local perturbations, and seem to have a topological origin, reminiscent of the protected electronic boundary modes that occur in the quantum Hall effect and in topological insulators. Here, we establish the connection between the topological mechanical modes and the topological band theory of electronic systems, and we predict the existence of new topological bulk mechanical phases with distinct boundary modes. We introduce one- and two- dimensional model systems that exemplify this phenomenon.},

abstract = {A zero mode, or floppy mode, is a non-trivial coupling of mechanical components yielding a degree of freedom with no resistance to deformation. Engineered zero modes have the potential to act as microscopic motors or memory devices, but this requires an internal actuation mechanism that can overcome unwanted fluctuations in other modes and the dissipation inherent in real systems. In this work, we show theoretically and experimentally that complex zero modes in mechanical networks can be selectively mobilized by non-equilibrium activity. We find that a correlated active bath actuates an infinitesimal zero mode while simultaneously suppressing fluctuations in higher modes compared to thermal fluctuations, which we experimentally mimic by high frequency shaking of a physical network. Furthermore, self-propulsive dynamics spontaneously mobilise finite mechanisms as exemplified by a self-propelled topological soliton. Non-equilibrium activity thus enables autonomous actuation of coordinated mechanisms engineered through network topology.},

@article{Lee2018TopologicalLaws,
abstract = {Despite intense interest in realizing topological phases across a variety of electronic, photonic and mechanical platforms, the detailed microscopic origin of topological behavior often remains elusive. To bridge this conceptual gap, we show how hallmarks of topological modes - boundary localization and chirality - emerge from Newton's laws in mechanical topological systems. We first construct a gyroscopic lattice with analytically solvable edge modes, and show how the Lorentz and spring restoring forces conspire to support very robust "dangling bond" boundary modes. The chirality and locality of these modes intuitively emerges from microscopic balancing of restoring forces and cyclotron tendencies. Next, we introduce the highlight of this work, a very experimentally realistic mechanical non-equilibrium (Floquet) Chern lattice driven by AC electromagnets. Through appropriate synchronization of the AC driving protocol, the Floquet lattice is "pushed around" by a rotating potential analogous to an object washed ashore by water waves. Besides hosting "dangling bond" chiral modes analogous to the gyroscopic boundary modes, our Floquet Chern lattice also supports peculiar half-period chiral modes with no static analog. With key parameters controlled electronically, our setup has the advantage of being dynamically tunable for applications involving arbitrary Floquet modulations. The physical intuition gleaned from our two prototypical topological systems are applicable not just to arbitrarily complicated mechanical systems, but also photonic and electrical topological setups.},

We present a mathematical model that explains how the edge mode chirality can be switched via controlled distortions of the underlying lattice. This effect allows the direction of the edge current to be determined on demand.

@article{Lepri2003ThermalLattices,
abstract = {Deriving macroscopic phenomenological laws of irreversible thermodynamics from simple microscopic models is one of the tasks of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. We consider stationary energy transport in crystals with reference to simple mathematical models consisting of coupled oscillators on a lattice. The role of lattice dimensionality on the breakdown of the Fourier's law is discussed and some universal quantitative aspects are emphasized: the divergence of the finite-size thermal conductivity is characterized by universal laws in one and two dimensions. Equilibrium and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics methods are presented along with a critical survey of previous numerical results. Analytical results for the non-equilibrium dynamics can be obtained in the harmonic chain where the role of disorder and localization can be also understood. The traditional kinetic approach, based on the Boltzmann-Peierls equation is also briefly sketched with reference to one-dimensional chains. Simple toy models can be defined in which the conductivity is finite. Anomalous transport in integrable non-linear systems is briefly discussed. Finally, possible future research themes are outlined. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Zhu2016PersistentTransfer,
abstract = {We consider the consequence of nonreciprocity in near-field heat transfer by studying systems consisting of magneto-optical nanoparticles.We demonstrate that, in thermal equilibrium, a nonreciprocal many-body system in heat transfer can support a persistent directional heat current, without violating the second law of thermodynamics. Such a persistent directional heat current cannot occur in reciprocal systems, and can only arise in many-body systems in heat transfer. The use of nonreciprocity therefore points to a new regime of near-field heat transfer for the control of heat flow in the nanoscale.},
